# Domains_MachineLearning
This is a fun side project of using/experimenting with Machine Learning algorithms to predict if a site is up and running given just the domain name. 

The development of this project has three phases. 

1. Phase 1 - Generation of learning datasets and testcases
2. Phase 2 - Running ML and other heuristic algorithms over testcases to generate test result
3. Phase 3 - Visualization and analyazation of the test results

The README.md files within each of the Phase directories discuss the process of each Phase in further detail.
